Q1. What is crossorigin attribute in script tag of CDN link of react ?
Ans.  The "crossorigin" attribute in the provided script tag is set to "crossorigin", which is shorthand for "anonymous".
Setting the "crossorigin" attribute to "anonymous" indicates that the React library can be loaded from a different domain and that it should not attempt to send any authentication information (such as cookies or authorization headers) along with the request.
So, in this case, the script tag is indicating that the React library should be loaded from a different domain using the "anonymous" mode, which is the default value for the "crossorigin" attribute.
